## Introduction
Sorting algorithms are a fundamental part of computer science and software development. This repository collects implementations of sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and others in a variety of programming languages. It serves as a reference for developers and students alike to understand how these algorithms are implemented across different platforms and languages.

## [Available Algorithms](https://github.com/Jithu-SM/sorting-algorithms-in-every-programming-language/blob/main/.algorithms/README.md)
Here are the algorithms we aim to cover:
- [Bitonic Sort](https://github.com/Jithu-SM/sorting-algorithms-in-every-programming-language/blob/main/.algorithms/README.md#1-bitonic-sort) 
- Block Sort
- Bogo Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Cocktail Shaker Sort
- Comb Sort
- Counting Sort
- Gnome Sort
- Heap Sort
- Insertion Sort 
- Intro Sort 
- Merge Sort 
- Pancake Sort 
- Quick Sort 
- Radix Sort 
- Randomized Quick Sort 
- Selection Sort
- Shell Sort
- Tim Sort

Feel free to suggest or contribute additional algorithms!

## How to Contribute
We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels. To contribute:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Implement a sorting algorithm in your preferred programming language.
3. Place your implementation in the correct folder (see [Directory Structure](#directory-structure)).
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your contribution.

### Contribution Guidelines
- Ensure your code is well-documented and readable.
- Include a test case or example demonstrating the algorithm.
- Follow the existing naming conventions for files and directories.
- Update the [Supported Programming Languages](#supported-programming-languages) and [Available Algorithms](#available-algorithms) sections in this README if applicable.

## Directory Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ c
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bubble_sort.c
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ quick_sort.c
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ python
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bubble_sort.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ quick_sort.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ java
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BubbleSort.java
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ QuickSort.java
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ javascript
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bubble_sort.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ quick_sort.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
```
Each programming language has its own folder, containing implementations of various sorting algorithms. File names should be in the format `algorithm_name.language_extension` (e.g., `quick_sort.py`).
